NOTE on 16th July '22 : I am working on this in my summer vacation, just to have a little bit of fun, and help others get into F# programming. Unfortunately my closest relatives and myself are going to have a rough ride for some weeks, dealing with one of these events that life will unevitably throw at us all. My focus must be there, and so this little demo project is going to have slow progress or maybe even grind to a halt for days while I try to cope with the crisis. Sorry about that.

NOTE on 20th July '22 : Our family crisis will likely continue through August, and I'm also back at work in August.

# Holistic
 
This is a work in progress, in order to reach the first goal.

The purpose is to combine other demonstrations into a "holistic" application - an application that applies GUI design and database access for a specific business purpose. Then for the GUI design Elmish.WPF is used, for database access Dapper is used, for programming F# is used, and the business purpose is the obligatory TODO-list demonstration application.

For more information on progress and ideas, have a look in the Issues tab of this repo.
